This is my first React App. 
I do not focus on styling. 
It demonstrates the ability to edit in real time from the input fields to the output documents. 
Uses .map, .filter, .find methods, as well as the spread and ternary operators. 
Uses React Hooks instead of class components, as they are cleaner and more readable.
